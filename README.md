## Testing formik
Examples on testing from Formik documentation in the below link do not work.
https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/blob/f5d76609b222ce583663add279ac76e807e2d0ba/README.md#testing-formik

### What I did
1. add enzyme and react-test-renderer as dependencies
2. add setupTests.js
3. used mount instead of shallow in ```FirstForm2.test.js```


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
